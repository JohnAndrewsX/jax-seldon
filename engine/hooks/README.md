# engine/hooks/

Scripts the engine ships for Omarchy's hook system (`omarchy-hook <name>`
runs `~/.config/omarchy/hooks/<name>` and every file in
`~/.config/omarchy/hooks/<name>.d/`, each as `bash <file> <args…>`).
Nothing here is installed by default.

## `theme-set.sh`

| | |
|---|---|
| Hook | `theme-set` — `omarchy-theme-set` runs it with the new theme slug after it wrote `~/.local/state/omarchy/current/theme.name` |
| Does | `seldon event theme theme-set --subject "$1"` |
| Installed by | the wizard (`seldon init`, WP-024), only when the user opts in: `omarchy hook install theme-set <path>/theme-set.sh` (copies it to `~/.config/omarchy/hooks/theme-set.d/` with mode 755) |
| Removed by | deleting `~/.config/omarchy/hooks/theme-set.d/theme-set.sh` |

Why it is optional: the `theme` collector (`engine/src/collectors/theme.rs`)
finds every change on the next `seldon capture` by comparing `theme.name`
with its cursor. The hook only adds the exact time of the switch. When the
ledger already holds a `theme-set` to the current slug since the
collector's last check, the collector writes nothing, so a switch is never
recorded twice.

Contract of the script:

- silent (stdout and stderr go to `/dev/null`) and always exit 0, so a
  missing or failing `seldon` never breaks a theme switch;
- does nothing when `seldon` is not on `PATH` or no slug is given;
- passes the slug as one argument; it is never evaluated (AGENTS.md §8).

`seldon event` is WP-006's command (SPEC-ENGINE §3); the script relies only
on `seldon event <source> <kind> --subject S`.
